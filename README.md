# Stress Prediction Project

## Overview
This machine learning project predicts university students' stress levels (1-5 scale) based on digital habits like mobile usage, social media, gaming, and sleep quality. It analyzes survey data, performs data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and uses a Random Forest model for predictions. Includes interactive tools and insights for better digital wellness.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of survey responses
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)
- Feature engineering and Random Forest modeling
- Interactive prediction functions
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance

## Dataset
- Source: Google Form Survey
- Total Responses: 100
- After Cleaning: 50 high-quality responses
- Target: Recent Stress Level (1-5)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
- Scikit-learn, Joblib
